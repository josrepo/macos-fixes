# macOS fixes
macOS has lots of annoying quirks and this repo contains some workarounds I have found to cope with them.

## Mouse button 4 and 5 
Using mouse button 4 and 5 on a third-party mouse seems to fire the event twice, once on up and once on down.
Using Karabiner-Elements we can disable the down event so the button does not feel like it is double clicking.

## Swap @ and "
The "British English" version of the magic keyboard has the @ and " keys in the American English locations.
If you are used to the British English layout, then using Karabiner-Elements we can swap these so you can retain your muscle memory.
